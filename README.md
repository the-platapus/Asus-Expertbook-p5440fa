# Asus-Expertbook-p5440fa
OpenCore 0.9.7 Config for MacOS Ventura (and above)

This build is based on OpenCore 0.9.7. Should support MacOS Ventura and above.

Tested MacOS versions: Ventura and Sonoma


Bugs:

Ports: HDMI port does not work.

Bluetooth: When pairing new device wait for it to show all the devices available before pairing or it will get stuck on pairing.


Whats working:
Everything except the HDMI Port.


Note for WiFi: 

Please change the itlwm airport kext to the version corresponding to your MacOS you want to run. By default it has the kext for MacOS Ventura.

I recommend setting Display resolution to 1080p for best performance. Lower resolutions tend to get a bit laggy in my experience.
